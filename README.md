flux Trello
==========

flux Trello is a Drupal 7 module which integrates most of the Trello REST API into Drupal and makes it useable inside Rules. This module is based on flux Service Extension which provides the basic functionality.

A small guide which shows how to use this module with rules can be found [here](https://github.com/Spezelechse/fluxmite/blob/master/Fluxmite%20Rules%20Guide.pdf).

This was part of my bachelor thesis.
